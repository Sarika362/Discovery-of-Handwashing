# Discovery of Handwashing 🧼

## Overview 🌟

Welcome to the "Discovery of Handwashing" project! This project delves into the impact of handwashing practices on reducing mortality rates in 19th-century clinics. By analyzing historical data from two clinics, we aim to understand how Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis's handwashing protocols, introduced in 1847, influenced patient outcomes.

## Datasets 📊

### Yearly Deaths Dataset 🗓️

- **File**: `dataset/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains yearly records of births and deaths from two clinics between 1841 and 1846, before handwashing was introduced.
- **Columns**:
  - `year`: The year of observation
  - `births`: Number of births
  - `deaths`: Number of deaths
  - `clinic`: Identifier for the clinic

### Monthly Deaths Dataset 📅

- **File**: `dataset/monthly_deaths.csv`
- **Description**: Monthly records of births and deaths, including data from the period when handwashing was implemented starting in June 1847.
- **Columns**:
  - `date`: Date of observation
  - `births`: Number of births
  - `deaths`: Number of deaths

## Analysis Steps 🔍

### 1. Data Exploration 🕵️‍♂️

We begin by exploring the datasets to understand their structure and content.

### 2. Data Visualization 📈

Visualize the data to compare:
- **Number of Deaths**: Analyze yearly deaths in both clinics.
- **Proportion of Deaths**: Examine the death rates relative to births over the years.

### 3. Impact of Handwashing 🚿

We analyze the monthly data to see how the implementation of handwashing from June 1847 affected the death rates. By comparing the periods before and after the introduction of handwashing, we assess its impact on mortality.

### 4. Key Findings 📉

- **Pre-Implementation**: High mortality rates observed in both clinics before 1847.
- **Post-Implementation**: Significant reduction in mortality rates after the introduction of handwashing.
- **Average Reduction**: The proportion of deaths decreased from approximately 10% to 2%, indicating an 8% reduction.

## Conclusion 🏆

The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of handwashing in reducing mortality rates, underscoring the importance of hygiene in medical practices.

## Future Work 🔮

- **Extended Analysis**: Investigate additional datasets to uncover long-term trends.
- **Factor Exploration**: Explore other potential factors influencing mortality rates.
